        <h2>Princess Bubblegum's Relationships</h2>
        <p>
            Princess Bubblegum has complex relationships with various characters in the Land of Ooo.
            Here are some of the key characters she interacts with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finn the Human - A good friend to Princess Bubblegum, but is also sometimes treated as a test subject. Despite 
		his feelings and attempts to woo her, Princess Bubblegum has rejected all of Finn's advances.</li>
            <li>Jake the Dog - Jake is also a friend to Princess Bubblegum, although sometimes she treats him more like a pet
		rather than an equal; an act that Jake seems to like taking part in.</li>
            <li>Marceline the Vampire Queen - Their complex relationship has made for some interesting episodes and subplots.
		In the later seasons, it is revealed that they have a lot of history together, and were implied to have been
		exes. Now, they are confirmed to be in a relationship by the creators.</li>
        </ul>
